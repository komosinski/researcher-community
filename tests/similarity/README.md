### This directory contains tests of various similarity measures of research papers.

Ideally, we want a measure that will assess the similarity of the text in a human-like way
â€“ i.e., two papers written using completely different words, or even languages,
but concerning the same (or similar) ideas, meaning and implications, should be assessed as identical (or nearly identical).

Since there is a trade-off between how the measure is "intelligent"/"understanding" and how fast it is to compute, we compare a few of them.
