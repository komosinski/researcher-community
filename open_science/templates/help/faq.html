<p class="question">May I publish my paper here and then submit it to some journal or conference?</p>

<p class="indent">
If your paper is original and they allow it (most publishers do), then yes.
If your paper that exists here gets accepted and published somewhere else, remember to indicate this in the last revision of your paper here.
</p>


<p class="question">May I publish my paper here given that it was already published in some journal or conference proceedings?</p>

<p class="indent">
This depends on the publishing agreement (if you signed any) or publisher's arrangements.
</p>


<p class="question">I have created an account. How can I get the <i>researcher</i> status to upload and review papers?</p>

<p class="indent">
You have to be endorsed by any researcher here (you can ask them for endorsement) or have a confirmed email address from an academic institution.
</p>



<p class="question">Can I really ask for reviews here? Who will review my paper?</p>

<p class="indent">
Endorsed researchers like you and me will review it, if they agree. This service relies on peer review, as it is traditionally done in research. The system will try to find reviewers matching the area of your paper while avoiding obvious conflicts of interest. This is why it is so important to invite your peers to join, so that all researchers can cooperate in our journey of scientific progress.
