<p class="question">May I publish my paper here and then submit it to some journal or conference?</p>

<p class="indent">If your paper is original and they allow it (most publishers do), then yes. If your paper that exists here gets accepted and published somewhere else, remember to indicate this in the last revision of your paper here.</p>



<p class="question">May I publish my paper here given that it was already published in some journal or conference proceedings?</p>

<p class="indent">This depends on the publishing agreement (if you signed any) or publisher's arrangements.</p>



<p class="question">I have created an account. How can I get the <i>researcher</i> status to upload and review papers?</p>

<p class="indent">You can ask other endorsed users (via the button in their profile pages) to endorse you. It is best to find peers who are verified researchers here and who know you personally (for example, you can search for an email address, or by name, or by affiliation). Alternatively, you can send a message to our staff (see the bottom of this page) to have your account endorsed.</p>



<p class="question">Can I really ask for reviews here? Who will review my paper?</p>

<p class="indent">Endorsed researchers like you and me will review it, if they agree. This service relies on peer review, as it is traditionally done in research. The system will try to find reviewers matching the area of your paper while avoiding obvious conflicts of interest. This is why it is so important to invite your peers to join, so that all researchers can cooperate in our journey of scientific progress.</p>



<p class="question">Does research.community provide DOI?</p>

<p class="indent">For now it does not, because DOIs are not free. However, research.community provides permanent links so you can use URLs to cite and refer to articles published here. DOIs can be supported if they will be needed and users will consider them worthy of paying a small fee.</p>



<p class="question">Does research.community support conferences?</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, you can use tags for this purpose. A researcher who is the organizer of the conference creates a tag (e.g., ICAM-2022-submission) and shares it with other organizers. They assign a deadline for reviews. Researchers wishing to participate in this conference publish their papers assigning them this tag. This way one can easily view all the articles that were submitted to a given conference. When asked to review such articles by the system or by the organizers, researchers are advised that they must submit their reviews before the deadline associated with the tag. Then the organizers create a second tag (e.g., ICAM-2022-final) with assigned deadline, select peer-reviewed articles (tagged ICAM-2022-submission) with a fair average rating, and ask their authors to upload the final version before the deadline and tag their final version with the second (final) tag.</p>
