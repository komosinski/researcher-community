            <h4>The "researcher status" and endorsement</h4>
                <p>Some users are automatically endrosed based on their institutional email address.
                <p>To get the researcher status, you can ask other endorsed users (via the button in their profile pages) to endorse you.
Alternatively, you can send a message to our staff to have your institution included or your particular account endorsed.
