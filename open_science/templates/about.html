<h1>About</h1>

<p>Researcher.community is an initiative that aims to
<ul>
<li>unite research across all branches and fields of science,
<li>make research results available to everyone for free,
<li>facilitate scientific progress by simplifying the technical aspects of submitting, discussing and reviewing research papers,
<li>reduce issues related to publishing and reviewing interdisciplinary work,
<li>serve as a global, open-source system that connects and unites through cooperation while discouraging fragmentation caused by competition,
<li>be continuously improved by the research community, evolving and adapting as needed.
</ul>
</p>

<p>This service is a community endeavor. If you are a researcher and you have any idea of how to improve this service, please join the community, get involved and let us know. Be a part of this initiative and share your skills for the benefit of all the researchers now and in the future. If possible, contribute a small amount of your time to help this system grow by telling your colleagues to participate (this is required for successful peer review), by suggesting improvements (there is a lot to improve!), or by supporting researcher.community financially (needed for the hardware infrastructure).</p>

<p>Ideally, the service should be financed by all the governments and public funds. For now it is entirely independent and relies on the support from people who believe that science should be freely accessible, and who want to accelerate the scientific progress of our civilization.</p>

<p>If you want to read more about the background and initial motivations to develop this system, there is a longer auto-translated text <a href="https://www-cs-put-poznan-pl.translate.goog/mkomosinski/site/?q=otwarta-nauka&_x_tr_sl=pl&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=pl">here</a>, but some finer points are lost in auto-translation.</p>
